			<h4>What does "Full" mean?</h4>
			<pre>
	The "Full" in full stack means that everything that a web designer can do, is done. This would include front end codeing
	which includes <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML5</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS3</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">JavaScript</a>. This front end coding is everything that you the viewer sees.
	The front end is also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)">client</a> and this is where information from the web page is being sent to, but full stack is
	not just coding front end. It also includes back end coding or sever side coding. This coding commonly includes <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp">PHP</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySql</a>,
	and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle</a> languages. This can very depending on what stack or sever your using. The Sever side is everything you the veiwer doesn't
	see and is where amny of your passwords and other things are stored.

			<h4>What does "stack" mean?</h4>
			<pre>
	The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">stack</a>" in full stack is a term that describes 
	what programs that a programer is using. This is exspecially important since there is a varity of different programs
	that do the same thing. So to be able to tell what programs/languages are being used, stacks were created. The programs used in this stack 
	is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML5</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS3</a>,
	<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp">PHP</a>, and <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySql</a>.

			<h4>What does "LAMP" stack mean?</h4>
			<pre>
	The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> stack is a kind of stack that is used in server side programming. 
	The L in the LAMP stack stands for <a href="https://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> which is the operating system that many programmers use.
	The A in LAMP stands for the Apache web server. This the web server used for uploading web sites and also the use of servers since it is one. The M 
	in LAMP stands for <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySql</a>. MySQL is the server language that is used for teh storing of data and other server related things. 
	The P in LAMP is the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp">PHP</a> language. The PhP language is the language that is
	used within the website itself all though you never see it.

			<h4>What is a database?</h4>
			<pre>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">Databases</a> are how computers store large amounts of information without having massive text files that would take up huge amounts of space.
	Databases are used in companies to store sales information and information about employees. You use databases when every you upload something to 
	Google Drive or any software of the sort. Many databases use tables to organize their information and they can store large amounts of information.
			</pre>
			<h4>What is MySQL?</h4>
			<pre>
	MySQL is a one of the many kinds of databases out there. It also is the second most commonly used database only behind the Oracle database.
	It is completly free and there are many tutorials for it making it easier to learn. It also uses the command line when coding in MySQL.
			</pre>
			<h4>What is SQL?</h4>
			<pre>
	SQL is the universal programming langauge that many databases run off of. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.The Sturctured stands
	for it being set up in a standred way. This often times has the database as a table. Query is a request to a computer. The querys you use are
	the requests that give information to you. So when you want Joey's information you use a Query. Almost every database uses this and MySQL is built
	apon this language.  
			</pre>
			<h4>What is PHP?</h4>
			<pre>
	PHP one of the many programming languages that connects the front end to the back end. PHP is the most common of these. What PHP does is that it reads
	the HTML forms and gives that information to the server. PHP can also read the database you use and uses that information to give information back to the
	HTML.
			</pre>
			<h4>how does a MySQL table work?</h4>
			<pre>
	The MySQL table works by having rows and colmumns in which the data is organized by their topic and other factors. The data is then organized and put into 
	cells. This look like an Excel file but it is much more complicated than that.

			<h4>MySQL from the CLI (Command Line Interface) -- NTS, sturcture when done</h4>
			<pre>
	1. The User Interface for DB's are HTML pages
	2. The CLI is where the Power Users can see inside of the DB but in a very primitive, just text, way. The CLI is mainly used by experts
